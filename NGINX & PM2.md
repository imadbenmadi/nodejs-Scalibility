Great question! Let's clarify how **PM2** and **NGINX** interact and why you need both to handle traffic efficiently.

### Does PM2 Automatically Split Traffic Across Instances?

**PM2** itself **does not automatically split HTTP traffic** between the instances it creates. PM2 is primarily a **process manager**. Its key job is to:
1. **Start multiple instances** of your Node.js app to utilize all available CPU cores.
2. **Monitor and restart** instances if they crash or go down.
3. Ensure **load distribution at the system/process level**, but not at the HTTP request level.

While PM2 creates multiple **Node.js instances**, it does **not act as a load balancer** for incoming HTTP traffic. This means that, without something like **NGINX** in front, **all incoming traffic will hit a single instance**, whichever is first available, because Node.js apps typically listen on a single port.

### Why Create Multiple PM2 Instances?

Even though PM2 doesn’t automatically split traffic, creating multiple instances with PM2 has several benefits:
1. **CPU Utilization**: Node.js is single-threaded, but by running **multiple instances**, each one can run on a different core. This allows your app to fully utilize multi-core systems. For example, with 2 cores, PM2 can spawn 2 instances—each running on its own core.
   
2. **Concurrency at Process Level**: Each instance of your app can handle its own event loop and queue of asynchronous tasks, making the overall system more responsive, even though each instance still handles its own HTTP requests.

3. **Process Management**: PM2 helps with restarting processes automatically if they crash, scaling up/down the number of instances, and monitoring the health of your instances.

### Why Use **NGINX** Alongside PM2?

Since PM2 doesn’t split incoming HTTP traffic across instances, you need something like **NGINX** to act as a **reverse proxy and load balancer** to distribute the traffic across all your instances.

Here's why:

- **Without NGINX (or any load balancer):**
  - You start multiple instances of your app using PM2, but they all run on different ports (e.g., 3001, 3002).
  - By default, if your app is configured to listen on port `3000`, **only one instance will receive traffic**, and the other instances won’t get any traffic unless explicitly accessed via their port.

  **Example:**
  - PM2 launches two instances: 
    - Instance 1 listens on port `3001`
    - Instance 2 listens on port `3002`
  - If a user sends a request to `http://yourdomain.com:3001`, only Instance 1 handles the request. If another user sends a request to `http://yourdomain.com:3002`, Instance 2 handles it.
  - However, users don’t know which port to access, and traffic isn't split efficiently.

- **With NGINX (or a load balancer):**
  - **NGINX** listens on a single port (e.g., `80` or `443` for HTTPS) and **forwards the requests to different PM2 instances** (e.g., `3001`, `3002`).
  - NGINX balances the traffic using different strategies like **round-robin**, **least connections**, or **IP hash** to ensure that all your instances share the load.

  **Example:**
  - User sends a request to `http://yourdomain.com`.
  - NGINX receives the request and forwards it to one of your PM2 instances (e.g., port `3001` or `3002`), balancing the traffic based on the configured strategy.

### Summary of the Roles:

1. **PM2’s Role**: 
   - PM2 spawns **multiple Node.js instances** (processes) and assigns them to different CPU cores. It manages these processes by restarting them when necessary and can distribute load at the **process level** by running instances on different cores.
   - PM2 does **not** split incoming HTTP traffic across instances automatically. It only manages processes.

2. **NGINX’s Role**: 
   - **NGINX** acts as a **reverse proxy and load balancer** to handle incoming HTTP requests. It ensures that traffic is distributed across the different Node.js instances created by PM2.
   - NGINX forwards the traffic to PM2 instances running on different ports (e.g., `3001`, `3002`), balancing the load across them.

### Why Not Just Use PM2 Without NGINX?

If you **don’t use NGINX**, your users will have to know the specific port for each instance, which isn’t practical. Also, there won’t be an automatic way to **balance the incoming traffic** across the instances. PM2 manages the processes themselves but doesn’t handle the routing of external requests across these processes.

NGINX solves that by providing a **single point of entry** (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com`) and splitting traffic between your PM2-managed Node.js instances.

### In Summary:
- **PM2** is great for managing and spawning multiple instances of your app across CPU cores, but it **does not** handle traffic distribution across instances by itself.
- **NGINX** is necessary to split incoming traffic across the instances created by PM2, ensuring each instance handles a share of the traffic.

Together, PM2 and NGINX help you both fully utilize system resources (multiple CPU cores) **and** efficiently distribute traffic across your app instances.
